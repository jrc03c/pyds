# Notes

- At some point, I need to decide how to handle NaN values! At the moment, most of the functions only operate on numbers, meaning that an error is thrown if an operand contains any non-numerical values!

- Should returned values always be (a) plain lists or (b) numpy arrays?

- Make sure that all `testErrors` methods use arrays of wrong values.

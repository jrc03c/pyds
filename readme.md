**Intro:**

This package is just a little collection of helper tools and classes for working with `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jrc03c/python_data_science_helpers
```

**Usage:**

```python
from python_data_science_helpers.helpers import *
# go on your merry way!
```

**Notes:**

I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm a newbie data scientist, and I'm not a Python expert. Please don't judge me too harshly. :)
